description: Menno's personal Linux image based on Fedora Silverblue / Kinoite

scripts:
  # "Pre" scripts run very early in the build, immediately after your custom
  # repos have been imported (so that you can access those repos if necessary).
  pre:
    # Automatically runs script files within "scripts/pre/".
    - autorun.sh
    # Manually listed scripts.
    # - example_pre.sh
  # "Post" scripts run at the end of the build process.
  post:
    # Automatically runs script files within "scripts/post/".
    - autorun.sh
    # Manually listed scripts.
    # - example_post.sh

# Custom RPM configuration.
# These changes will be integrated into your custom image at the "system level".
rpm:
  # A list of urls of ".repo" files that should be added to your system.
  # This is the proper way to add custom COPR repos to your image.
  # Tip: Use `%FEDORA_VERSION%` instead of static Fedora version numbers,
  # so that your repos automatically use your image's actual Fedora version,
  # which greatly simplifies future maintenance of your custom recipe.
  repos:
    - https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/fedora/tailscale.repo

  # These RPMs will be installed from your enabled repositories (Fedora's own
  # repos, extra "repos" you've added, etc). The installation is automatically
  # performed via rpm-ostree during the image build, and will be pre-installed
  # at the "system level" in the final image.
  install:
    # Needed for yafti (the first boot installer). Remove if you're not using yafti.
    - python3-pip
    # GNOME's GTK4 theme, Libadwaita. Already included in Silverblue, but not
    # other spins. You can remove if you aren't using yafti, but many native
    # apps and binaries require it, so it's a good idea to always include it
    # if you ever download or compile any custom software on your machine.
    - libadwaita
    - powertop
    - docker-compose
    - tailscale

  # These RPMs will be removed from the system image. This step happens during
  # image build, BEFORE installing custom RPMs (from the "rpm.install" category).
  remove:
    # Remove the native firefox (from Fedora) in favor of the Flatpak.
    - firefox
    - firefox-langpacks

# Configuration for the "first boot" experience, which is available after login.
firstboot:
  # Whether to embed "yafti" into the OS image and configure it to autostart,
  # which is the preferred uBlue "first boot" GUI. Set this to "false" if you've
  # decided to use a different solution instead.
  yafti: true
  # These Flatpaks will be suggested for install after user login, via the yafti
  # "first boot" GUI. Everything below will be merged into the "yafti.yml" config
  # on build, in a category named "Custom". If you prefer, you can instead remove
  # everything below and directly edit "yafti.yml" to have more control.
  # Alternatively, if you've disabled "yafti", you can still install these via
  # the "just setup-flatpaks" command from our "custom.just" template file.
  # This is just an example selection:
  flatpaks:
    - io.github.celluloid_player.Celluloid
    - org.kde.krita
    - org.mozilla.firefox
    - org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
    - com.github.tchx84.Flatseal
