# mblue2

This repository creates a [a native container image](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable)
customised for my personal laptops. It's based on the excellent images from the team at
[Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) with only minor tweaks. Universal Blue is itself a customisation of [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/silverblue/).

New images are produced every 3 days, pulling in the latest upstream Silverblue
updates. Both NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA images are produced as I have some machines
with NVIDIA cards.

## Creating your Own Image

If you're interested in creating your own image, first try out the [base
Universal Blue images](https://universal-blue.org/installation/) and then check
out [Make Your Own-page in the documentation](https://universal-blue.org/tinker/make-your-own/).
